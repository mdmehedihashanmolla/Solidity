Functions are essential for defining logic and interacting with smart contracts.

Modifiers allow you to reuse and centralize access control and validation logic.

Pure functions only depend on input and do not alter or read from the blockchain state.

View functions can read but not alter the state, making them useful for querying data.

Fallback functions help handle incoming Ether or unrecognized function calls.

Restricted access ensures that only authorized users can interact with certain contract functions, improving security.
