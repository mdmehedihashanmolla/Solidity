/* What is solidity ? 

  Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language used to 
  write smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchain platforms that are 
  compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). These smart contracts are 
  self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

/*
    Bytecode

    Bytecode is the low-level code that is generated after smart contract written
    in a high-level language like solidity is compiled. It is a sequence of
    instructions (opcodes) that can  be understood and executed by the Ethereum 
    Virtual Machine (EVM).

    The bytecode is what gets deployed to the Ethereum Blockchain when you pulish
    a smart contract.

/*
    ABIs

    In Ethereum, an ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a standarlized way for interacting
    with smart contract, It define how data should be encoded and decoded when being sent to 
    and from a contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
